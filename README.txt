pulp-os -- e-reader firmware for the XTEink X4

bare-metal e-reader operating system for the XTEink X4 board

building
    requires stable Rust >= 1.88 and the riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
    target. rust-toolchain.toml handles both automatically.

runtime
    embassy async executor on esp-rtos. five concurrent tasks:

    main            event loop: input dispatch, app work, rendering
    input_task      10 ms ADC poll, debounce, battery read (30 s)
    housekeeping    status bar (5 s), SD check (30 s), bookmark flush (30 s)
    idle_timeout    configurable idle timer, signals deep sleep
    worker_task     background CPU-heavy work (HTML strip, image decode)

    CPU sleeps (WFI) whenever all tasks are waiting.

design notes
    kernel / app split. the kernel (kernel/, board/, drivers/, ui/)
    has zero imports from apps/ or fonts/. the scheduler is generic
    over an AppLayer trait; it never names a concrete app. AppId is
    defined by the distro, not the kernel -- the kernel only knows
    AppIdType::HOME. font-dependent widgets live in apps/widgets/.
    the kernel ships a built-in mono font (FONT_6X13) for the boot
    console and sleep screen; proportional fonts are app-side.

    boot console. kernel accumulates text lines during hardware init
    and renders them to the EPD in the built-in mono font before
    the app layer takes over. works with zero fontdue, zero TTFs.

    no dyn dispatch. with_app!() macro matches AppId, expands to
    concrete calls per app struct. all monomorphised; no vtable.

    apps never touch hardware. KernelHandle mediates all I/O (SD,
    dir cache, bookmarks) and is only passed in via on_enter/background.

    dirty-region tracking. apps call ctx.mark_dirty(region); regions
    are unioned per frame. partial DU or full GC issued accordingly.

    strip rendering. 12 x 40-row strips (4 KB each) instead of a
    48 KB framebuffer. draw callback fires per strip during DMA.
    windowed mode for partial refresh; widgets use logical coords.

    heavy statics. large structs live in ConstStaticCell / StaticCell
    so the async future stays ~200 B. taken once, passed as &'static mut.

    nav stack. Launcher<Id> holds a 4-deep stack of any AppIdType.
    transitions (Push/Pop/Replace/Home) drive on_suspend / on_enter
    lifecycle.

    quick menu. power button opens a per-app overlay; drawn inline
    during the strip pass. refresh and go-home always available.

    heap budget. ~172 KB heap (108 KB main + 64 KB reclaimed from
    bootloader). used only for epub chapter text and image decode
    (alloc::vec). rest is stack/static.

    smol-epub. companion no_std crate: ZIP/DEFLATE, OPF spine,
    streaming HTML strip, 1-bit Floyd-Steinberg PNG/JPEG decoders.
    all I/O via generic read closure; storage-agnostic.

    input. ADC ladders sampled at 100 Hz, 4-sample oversampling,
    15 ms debounce, long-press and repeat detected in driver.
    ButtonMapper maps physical buttons to semantic actions.

    fonts. build.rs rasterises TTFs via fontdue into 1-bit bitmaps
    at five sizes. book and UI sizes independently hot-swappable.

    work queue. background embassy task for CPU-heavy work (HTML strip,
    image decode). generation-based cancellation; channel capacity 1
    for natural back-pressure.

    SPI bus sharing. EPD and SD card share a single SPI bus via
    CriticalSectionDevice. background SD I/O finishes before any
    EPD render pass to avoid RefCell borrow conflicts.

    layered architecture. drivers (layer 0) know nothing of apps.
    kernel (layer 1) owns hardware resources and is generic over
    AppLayer -- it never imports from apps/. apps (layer 2-3)
    interact only through KernelHandle. board/ is kernel-side;
    fonts/ and apps/widgets/ are app-side.

    forkable kernel. the kernel is designed to be extracted into
    its own crate and forked for other "distros". a fork defines
    its own AppId enum, implements AppLayer, brings its own fonts
    and apps, and writes a main.rs that wires everything together.
    the kernel provides hardware drivers, scheduling, storage,
    bookmarks, config, and a working EPD with a mono boot console.
